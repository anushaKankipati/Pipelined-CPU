The final project for CSEN 122 (Computer Architecture) at Santa Clara University.

The project is to design a structural model of a 32-bit pipelined CPU with 13 instructions using
Verilog HDL given a custom SCU Instruction Set Architecture.
We used Vivado to simulate our CPU, therefore this repo is a copy of the Vivado project directory.
